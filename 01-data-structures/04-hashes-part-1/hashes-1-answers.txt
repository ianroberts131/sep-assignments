1. Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
Doubling the size of the underlying array doesn't do a good job of ensuring unique array indices.
Thus, the underlying array will frequently need to be doubled in order to produce a unique index,
which is very costly in terms of memory use and speed. Using the next largest prime number, on the other hand,
does a much better job of producing unique indices and thus expands less frequently (i.e. fewer collisions).
